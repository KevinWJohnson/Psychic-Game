Guess a letter game


Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

The game give the user 9 guesses to guess the letter randomly selected by the app. If the user picks the 
letter randomly selected by the app before 9 guesses, it is recorded by the app as a win. If the user fails
to pick the letter radomly selected by the app in 9 guesses, it is recorded as a loss. The specific letters
guessed by the user are displayed. When a win or a loss occurs, the game updates the Wins and Losses totals,
the specific letters guessed by the user are cleared, and the game starts over.
